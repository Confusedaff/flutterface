# FlutterFace

A basic demo app for running face recognition locally on your phone using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite). 
This is possible with the use of the [tflite_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter) plugin. 

We use [BlazeFace](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05047) for face detection and [MobileFaceNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07573) for creating embeddings.

- Reused large parts of the [FlutterWithMediaPipe](https://github.com/JaeHeee/FlutterWithMediaPipe) (and one [fork](https://github.com/lcw99/FlutterWithMediaPipe)) project for the face detection part.
